# YAGA solver - Yet Another Genetic Algorithm solver
This project aims to provide a Python implementation of an evolutionary algorithm solver for sequence-based problems and beyond.
The 0.1 version was designed specifically as a script to solve the travelling salesman problem for up to 30 vertices.

# Requirements
- numpy
- matplotlib

# Changelog
- 0.1 - First version: TSP solver in script form

# TODO
- interface for custom fitness functions
- interface for custom genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation)
- generalize usage purposes
